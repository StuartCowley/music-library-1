# Music Library ðŸŽ¶

**First project with [Manchester Codes](https://www.manchestercodes.com/) BACKEND module**

The purpose of this project was to apply all learned aspects together in one project by building an API (Application Programming Interface) app to manage a database, a music library.

The project followed TDD principles by writing a failing test and write the code to pass the test. This time we used Mocha supertest, an integration test which checks that app is communicating with the database.

**Project status**

Completed and deployed with Heroku [here](https://music-library-helid.herokuapp.com/artist). Use Postman as a client to insert an artist to the database.

Possible ways to continue this project:

- extend the app to include album table.

- connect artist id to album

I have left some commented out code which is not working just as a notes for myself.

**Comments**

The project has streghten my knowledge of the complex _BACKEND_ development, _ODD (Object oriented programming)_ by keeping ROUTES, CONTROLLERS and SERVICES separate and of course again highlighed the importance of the testing environment.
